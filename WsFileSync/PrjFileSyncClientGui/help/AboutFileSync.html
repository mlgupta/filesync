              File Synchronizer syncs network files, making it easy to move new or updated files and file permissions and keeps mirrored directories up-to-date. It is also a smart way to protect data in the event of a disaster. DBSentry FileSync is a robust cross platform file synchronizer. Developed using the JXTA technology FileSync delivers an application that provides transparent connectivity and ease of use. Modular design of the system allows one to interact with many document storage sources (Presently, Unix file system, Samhita Document Management System, and Oracle's CMSDK are supported as server side document storage). FileSync allows one to maintain same version of files on all of your machines reducing annoyance of copying files back and forth. When working on same files on different machines, it makes sure that working copy is the most recent copy. FileSync allows one to share files easily. This feature is especially useful when people are working remotely or are working in a collaborative group in which file sharing is critical.        </td>
