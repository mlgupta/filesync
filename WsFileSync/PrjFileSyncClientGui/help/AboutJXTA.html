        <td height="122" colspan="2"><p><STRONG class="textBold_12_663399">JXTA</STRONG> technology is a set of open protocols that allow any connected device on the network ranging from cell phones and wireless PDAs to PCs and servers to communicate and collaborate in a P2P manner. JXTA peers create a virtual network where any peer can interact with other peers and resources directly even when some of the peers and resources are behind firewalls and NATs or are on different network transports. Thus, access to the resources of the network is not limited by platform incompatibilities or the constraints of a hierarchical client-server architecture. JXTA technology espouses the core technology objectives of ubiquity, platform independence, interoperability, and security. JXTA technology runs on any device, including cell phones, PDAs, two-way pagers, electronic sensors, desktop computers, and servers. Based on proven technologies and standards such as HTTP, TCP/IP and XML, JXTA technology is not dependent on any particular programming language, networking platform, or system platform and can work with any combination of these. Interoperability is a central goal, and JXTA technology is designed to enable interconnected peers to easily locate and communicate with each other, participate in community-based activities, and offer services to each other seamlessly across different platforms and networks. Integrated security mechanisms such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), digital certificates, and certificate authorities help ensure security while facilitating free-flowing communication. </p>
